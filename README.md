# 2024Swerve
Best Practices:
- Use .gitignore files
    - Copy one from a previous project out on Pearadox GitHub
- Use the VsCode source control to clone the repositories rather than downloading as a .zip file
- Make sure to update the .gitconfig file with your email and user name so the GitHub commits have the right user info
- Always add a comment
- Install extensions
    - GitHub pull requests and issues
    - Git Extension Pack
    - GitLens
    - Git gui
- Make sure .gitconfig is using your email and name (either directly or using git commands)
  - Set a Git username: git config --global user.name "Mona Lisa"
  - Set a Git email: config --global user.email "you@example.com"
- issue notes in subsystem_programming if necessary
- if creating brand new repo:
	1. create new repo in github
	2. clone repo to laptop
	3. copy over code into repo folder 
- Implement Continuous Integratrion (guide in Slack, will document fully later) 

Pull Request Sequence:
1. create branch in VSCode (if you dont have one already)
2. publish branch 
3. make any changes
4. save changes and commit to your branch
5. make a pull request for your commits from VSCode
